📊 Pandas Data Cleaning & Transformation – Checkpoint

📝 Project Overview

This checkpoint focuses on learning how to clean, transform, and query datasets using the pandas library in Python. By working with a sample employee dataset, we explored how to select specific rows and columns using both index-based (iloc) and label-based (loc) operations.

🔧 Dataset Used

A small mock dataset containing employee information:

Columns: Name, Department, Age, Gender, Salary, Experience

✅ Tasks Performed

1. Created a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary.

2. Selected the first 3 rows using iloc.

3. Filtered rows where Department is "Marketing" using loc.

4. Selected specific columns (Age and Gender) from the first 4 rows using iloc.

5. Extracted Salary and Experience for all male employees using loc.

🧠 Skills Learned

Creating and manipulating DataFrames in pandas

Using .iloc[] for position-based selection

Using .loc[] for condition-based filtering and label-based selection

Basic data cleaning and querying techniques

Interpreting and slicing tabular data efficiently
